# This Repository will Contains nearly all problems on leet code
The idea is to create a repository that contains most of famous problems and there solutions

# Problem Index
 1. [Two Sum](./1_to_100/1)-
        Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
        You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

 2. [Add Two Numbers](./1_to_100/2)-
        Add two numbers without use of BigInt and with the help of linked lists
 3. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./1_to_100/3)-
       Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 4. [Subarray with maximum sum](./1_to_100/4)- 
       find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
