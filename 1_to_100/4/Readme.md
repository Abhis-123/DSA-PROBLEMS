# Problem : Maximum Subarray
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.


# Example :

    input  =  [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
    max_subarray(input) returns 6
    explanation -> [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
